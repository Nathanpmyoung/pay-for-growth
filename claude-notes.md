### App Requirements Documented:
**Pay For Growth** - Community subscription platform for Labour Growth Group MPs
- £50/month subscriptions with automatic equal splitting among active MPs
- Stripe integration for payments and webhooks
- Real-time payment tracking and transparent revenue sharing
- Member management for active/inactive status

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Document requirements and remove template instructions  
2. Plan MVP implementation with data models and core flows
3. Implement subscription management and payment splitting
4. Add member management and dashboard

### Important Context:
- This is a full-stack TypeScript template: React + Vite + TanStack Router + Convex + Clerk
- Need to remove demo content but keep useful structure
- Must follow commit-after-each-request workflow
